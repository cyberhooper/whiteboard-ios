# Whiteboard iOS

Whiteboard is Fueled's standard starting project for photo sharing platforms.
It is basically Parse's Anypic, but decoupled from Parse.

It features uploading picture, comments, likes and followers. 
It was meant to be modular and easy to modify. Whiteboard comes with a data source/database built with Parse, but it can be modified or extended to use other backend services (such as a custom backend) or other methods of data storage (such as Core Data).

## Getting Started

Get the project on your machine : 

    git clone git@github.com:Fueled/whiteboard-ios-2.git
    
Install pods

    pod update

If you don't have Cocoapods installed on your machine, follow the installation here : http://cocoapods.org/

Launch the iPhone test App called "WBAnypic" and you're all set!

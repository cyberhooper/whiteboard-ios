# Whiteboard iOS

Whiteboard is Fueled's standard starting project for photo sharing platforms. That's mean upload picture, comment, like, add and remove follower. 
It was meant to be modular and easy to modify. Whiteboard comes with a data source/database built from Parse, but can be modified to use other backend services (such as a custom backend) or other methods of data storage (such as Core Data).
